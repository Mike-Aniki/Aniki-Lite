# Recommended settings

### In Desktop Mode:

## For wallpapers and covers:

_I advise you to use the square format for the game covers and to use Universal PSN Metadata to get the square covers as well as the screen backgrounds. If I advise you to do this, it's because playstation screen backgrounds often have the character on the right of the image and all my themes are created on this basis with the character on the right._

### How to make the covers and backgrounds downloaded automatically when adding a game be those of PSN Metadata :

>Access the settings by clicking on the Playnite icon shaped like a controller, at the top left.
>- Select "Settings."
>- Go to the "Metadata" tab and choose "PSN Store" in the settings for "Covers" and "Background Image."
>- You can add more than one metadata source, but make sure you have PSN metadata first in the list, so it will prioritize psn metadata, but if it doesn't find any, it will search with the 2nd metadata source, and so on.
>- For other elements, choose the metadata source that suits you.

### How to convert game covers to square format :

>Access the settings by clicking on the Playnite icon shaped like a controller, at the top left.
>- Select "Settings."
>- Next, go to the "Appearance/Grid view" and set the "Target aspect ratio" to 1:1.
>- Save the changes using the "Save" button at the bottom of the window.

### How to update all metadata of my games

>Clicking on the Playnite icon shaped like a controller, at the top left.
>- Go to "Library" and click on Download Metadata, or use the CTRL+D shortcut.
>- A new window appears, check the "All Games From Database" box, uncheck the "only missing metadata" box and press next.
>- In the new window you can choose all the sources for each type of metadata, if you have already configured this correctly in the settings no need to touch or otherwise choose the source you want and press "Download".

## For logos :

>Access the settings by clicking on the Playnite icon shaped like a controller, at the top left.
>- Go to "Add-on/Generic/Extra Metadata Loader/Logo Settings."
>- In the "logo loader" settings, set the following values:
>Maximum Width: 600
>Maximum Height: 320

## For Trailer :

>For the "Trailer" button to work, video preview must be deactivated.
>- Access the settings by clicking on the Playnite joystick icon in the top left-hand corner.
>- Go to "Add-on/Generic/Extra Metadata Loader/Video settings" and uncheck the "Show video preview when video is not playing".

## Setting In Full-Screen Mode :

>Access the settings by clicking on the gear-shaped icon.
>- In the "Layout" section, choose "8" for the number of columns and "25" for spacing to achieve a balanced appearance.
